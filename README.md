# Project Progress

# (28/01/26)
## What was added to the game:
> 1. Refactored some bits of code (made menu buttons a vector, made a function to gather surrounding tiles).
> 2. Started working on level editor, currently can place grass tiles and remove them.

## Need to focus on next:
> 1. Add a choice for tile types and saving to level to file.
> 2. Work on more accurate collisions (player stops on either side and bottom so they cant jump through the tiles or walk through them).
> 3. Add a double jump to the player.
> 4. Add a dash to the player.
