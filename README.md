# Project Progress

# (28/01/26)
## What was added to the game:
> 1. Added new font.
> 2. Added title screen.
> 3. Added background for menu.
> 4. You can now choose to place grass or brick tiles in the editor by pressing 1 or 2 respectively, and right click to remove a tile.


## Need to focus on next:
> 1. Add saving level to file.
> 2. Work on more accurate collisions (player stops on either side and bottom so they cant jump through the tiles or walk through them).
> 3. Rework player movement.
> 4. Add a double jump to the player.
> 5. Add a dash to the player.
