# Project Progress

## What the game has currently (21/11/25):
> 1. Basic implementation of player. Moving left/right and jumping. Currently manages states with an enum class within the Player.h file.
> 2. Platforms along with a simple collision system that set the player's ground level to be that of the top of the platform if they collide.

## Need to focus on next:
> 1. Implement an animation loader and put in temporary assets.
> 2. Work on the collision system to include platforms that are like walls which stop the player from going through them, also fix current collision 
(looks choppy).
> 3. Adding more states to the player. (Falling, dashing, double jump ability).
