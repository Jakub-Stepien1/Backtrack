# Project Progress

# (03/02/26)
## What was added to the game:
> 1. Updated title screen assets; Clicking mouse now also goes to menu from title screen.

## Need to focus on next:
> 1. Research resource holders for texture, could be better in the long run.
> 2. Add saving level to file.
> 3. Work on more accurate collisions (player stops on either side and bottom so they cant jump through the tiles or walk through them).
> 4. Rework player movement.
> 5. Add a double jump to the player.
> 6. Add a dash to the player.
