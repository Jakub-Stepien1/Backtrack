# Project Progress

# (29/01/26)
## What was added to the game:
> 1. Updated some assets.
> 2. Added background layers for gameplay.
> 3. Made a viewport that's zoomed in and follows the player.
> 4. Implemented a parallax background for gameplay


## Need to focus on next:
> 1. Add saving level to file.
> 2. Work on more accurate collisions (player stops on either side and bottom so they cant jump through the tiles or walk through them).
> 3. Rework player movement.
> 4. Add a double jump to the player.
> 5. Add a dash to the player.
